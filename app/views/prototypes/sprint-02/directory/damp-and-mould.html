      <p class="govuk-body-l">If you have a problem with damp and mould, you must tell your landlord.</p>

      <p>Keep a record of all conversations, emails and messages.</p>

      <p>Government guidance says that landlords should take damp and mould seriously.</p>

      <p>Your landlord must try to find out what's causing the problem.</p>

      <p>You should give your landlord access to your home to check the issue. </p>

      <p>They can contact you to agree a suitable date and time to visit.</p>

      <p>If your landlord cannot identify the cause of the problem, they should ask a damp surveyor. You do not have to pay for this.</p>
