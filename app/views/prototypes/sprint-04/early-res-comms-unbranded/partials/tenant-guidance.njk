            <p>It lets you live in a property as long as you pay your rent and follow the rules. It also sets out the legal terms and conditions of your tenancy. It can be written down or oral (a spoken agreement).</p>
            <p>A tenancy can either be:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>fixed-term (running for a set period of time)</li>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Rent increases</h3>
            <p>If your landlord wants to increase your rent, they must serve you with a formal notice known as a Section 13 notice. Normally, this notice must be served one month before a new rent starts.</p>
            <p>They can only raise your rent once every 12 months - you can challenge the amount of the increase if you feel it is unreasonable.</p>
